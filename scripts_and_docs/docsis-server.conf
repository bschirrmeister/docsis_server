# This is the config file for the docsis_server for
# DOCSIS cable modems and customer PC equipment.
#
# It includes a DHCP server, a TFTP server, a UDP TIME
# server and SYSLOG server.

# This file needs to be located at /etc/docsis-server.conf

Server-Name		test-server1
Admin-Email		admin@testdomain.com
SMTP-server		smtp.testdomain.com


# server 1 is the only server that assigns new ips.
# all other servers must have a higher id number.
Server-ID		1


# The effective userid that the server will run with.
# I recommend you install the "docsis" user with the
# INSTALL.uid script
Effective-UserID	docsis


# The following settings are either (yes or no)
Activate-DHCP		yes
Activate-TFTP		yes
Activate-TIME		yes
Activate-SYSLOG		yes
Activate-BACKG		no


# Ethernet device to use dhcp server on.
DHCP-Interface		eth1

# Normally if a CPE comes up on a different interface, the system
# will delete their old IP and give them a new IP in the correct network.
# If you are doing RF rewiring or IP changes you might want to suspend
# that activity until you are sure everything is set up correctly.
DHCP-CPE-wrong-net-delete	yes


# The location of your static modem config files.
TFTP-Dir        /home/docsis/tftpboot

# Enable a Default-config for CMs

ModemDefault	no
#ModemDefaultFile	no-service.bin

# If you want to double check the dynamic config files
# that are being created you can set this setting to YES
# and create a "dynamic" directory in your TFTP-dir.
# It must be owned by your Effective-UserID
Dynamic-Config-Debug	no


# Secret Key for Dynamic Config File authorization
Config-Secret-Key       Secret-Key


# When a file goes unused in the TFTP file cache
# it will eventually be deleted from memory.
# This option sets that delete time in seconds.
# If you have a small set of generic files you can
# safely increase this to 86400.
# If you have a different config file for every modem
# you can lower this number to 300.
TFTP-Cache-Time			3600


# Dynamic config files are also cached but since you have
# a different file for each modem you don't want to cache
# for very long. If you have a low memory server you should
# reduce this quite a bit.
TFTP-Dynamic-Cache-Time		60


# You need to specify a MySQL server host, user, password, database

# If the system load average is greater than or equal to this value
# any Database Querys / Updates will be collected and sent through
# after the load average goes down.
Suspend-Load-Avg		2.0

# If the DHCP server receives X amount of his a second it will
# go into High Load mode. Instead of doing a sql query for each
# request it will use in memory caches.
DHCP-High-Load			16


# The DHCP server has a cache of cable modem IPs that it can use
# instead of doing SQL queries. This can greatly speed up the
# DHCP server when you have a lot of modems trying to reaquire.
# There are 2 parameters. Load selects the system load average that
# the cache will turn on. When load average is still low (it is only
# checked every 1 or 2 minutes) the cache will take effect when
# the server has taken however many Hits in one second.
Modem-Cache-Load	0.75
Modem-Cache-Hits	5


# When something bad happens we will call this program.
# 1: When we run out of IP addresses
# We use a special pager gateway to notify our on-call staff
# The program has to sit in /tmp because we are chroot jailed there.

# The following settings allow you to automagically rotate
# the logs files from the dhcp database into a backup database.
# If you don't want to rotate these logs, set the days to zero.

# This setting will delete any rotated logs or syslogs after they
